Re-Console is the official modpack for the Legacy4J mod, seeking to expand upon it, improve performance and add QoL features on top of the mod itself.



## 📥 Installation Guide
There are multiple ways to install and experience Re-Console: Legacy.
## 3rd Party Launchers
### Modrinth Launcher (Recommended)
For the easiest possible installation, I recommend using the Modrinth Launcher. It's light, easy to use, reasonably quick, and only takes a few clicks to set up. Once you have it installed, you can install Re-Console by searching for the modpack in the Modpacks section.
### Prism/MultiMC
Although more complicated, you can install Prism Launcher from their website. Prism is much more versatile and stronger as a launcher, but has a worse GUI. From there, add an instance and search "Modrinth" for Re-Console.


## 🐛 How to Report Issues
Please use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page if you are experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues. Be sure to include necessary information like your hardware/software (such as the GPU and CPU, modpack version and OS) so that it's easier for us to find issues and resolve them.


# 🎯 Goals

### 🔍 Accuracy
Re-Console seeks to be accurate to an idea of "Legacy Console Edition if it never ended". This means the modpack does not seek to re-create old versions, but rather make LCE in the modern versions.

### ⚙️ Open Source
Re-Console is comprised of only open-source or source-available mods, which gives you the ability to see the code and contribute to the mods in the pack. Without mod developers hard work, Re-Console would not be possible. If you want to show the developers of these mods your appreciation, I encourage you to donate to them!

### 🚀 Performant
Re-Console is built off and kept in sync with [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) by [devin](https://modrinth.com/user/devin), the performance modpack officially endorsed by Sodium.
This means Re-Console comes with all the features within [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), including;
- Improved rendering & game logic performance
- Improved memory and hardware usage
- Improved world generation speed

### 📩 Up to Date
Re-Console is usually one of the first modpacks to update in a stable state to new Minecraft and Legacy4J versions. It is also multi-version and multi-loader, giving you the choice between Latest MC (currently 1.21.1) and a version with long-term mod compatibility (currently 1.20.1) Fabric, Forge and Neoforge.
